# LiveElmExperiments

This project shows a way of integrating Elm and Phoenix LiveView by using Hooks and Phoenix components.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit  from your browser.

## Examples
  * [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) -> Elm running from a non liveview page (`home.html.heex`)
  * [`localhost:4000/counter`](http://localhost:4000/counter) -> Examples from integrating liveview and elm (`counter_live`)
